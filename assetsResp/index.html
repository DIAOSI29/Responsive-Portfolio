        Hello everyone, my name is Tian Qin. It is with great pleasure to be a
        member of this coding bootcamp and please let me briefly introduce
        myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent my first 20+ years of my life in China and then in 2011, I came
        to Australia to start my post-graduate study at UWA. After gradutation,
        I have done different types of work, from barista, resturant manager, to
        building material sales representative. I liked all the jobs that I had
        done as I can establish communication and understanding of poeple with
        different backgrounds, needs, personalities, life-styles as well as
        life-attitudes. I have always been passionate about the changes that
        happened around us due to the development of technology. I am a solid
        Apple fan as well as sneakerhead, with a fairly sizable collection of
        popular and limitely-released shoes. I used to play games a lot on
        multiple platforms but now I'd rather spend my spare time on enjoying
        some good feed. During the past few years I have done some self-study on
        graphic design using Adobe suites, and I have successfully been able to
        assist my current employer and building industry leader in marketing
        material and product packaging design works. I appreciate the beauty of
        the world and I wish I can, using my knowledge and skills, continually
        create things (in any form) to add more beauty to it.
